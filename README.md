I recently developed a brute force attack tool using Python, intended for ethical hacking and penetration testing purposes. This tool automates the process of systematically trying various combinations of passwords to gain unauthorized access to a system. By leveraging multi-threading, it can perform attacks efficiently, significantly reducing the time required to crack passwords. The tool is designed to integrate seamlessly with popular wordlists and can be customized to target different types of authentication mechanisms. This project highlights my understanding of cybersecurity threats and showcases my capability to create effective tools for testing and improving system security.
